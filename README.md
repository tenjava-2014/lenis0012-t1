Docs
----
This plugin adds new hidden chests to the world that contain new weapons.
Sadly i only made 1 weapon because i ran out of time
My alarm clock didn't go off and im going to a party.
Players with the permission 'tenjava.chests.notifyspawn' get a notification when a chest spawns.

Chests
------
Chests have a certain chance of spawning in a newly generated chunk.
They spawn in a range of 20-30Y by default which can be changed.
OPs will receive notifications with the locations so that you can teleport to it and grab your loot.

Weapons
-------
Left click to use weapons
Thor's hammer:
Thor's hammer an iron axe that shoots fireballs at a custom speed.
Once this ball hits a block it created an amazing explosion and strike lightning.
I recommend shooting this on trees for optimal amusement.
